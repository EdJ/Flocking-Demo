"Flocking" is the behaviour of birds or insects when in flight.

It can easily be reproduced with a few simple rules, and this is a quick demo of those rules in action, written in XNA. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior) for more detail).

Requirements
 - .NET 4
 - XNA Framework 4

Known Issues:
 - The collision detection is currently slightly wonky, due to various changes to get the project in a state worth publishing
